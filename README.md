1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  The problem that I was solving in the projects for this course was to create a program for the Computer Science department at ABCU that would load data from a .txt file into a data structure. Then the program needed to allow the user to print a list of all of the Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order and search for a specific course and print out it's information and prerequisites.
  
2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  I approached this program by first making sure I understood exactly what the client wanted from the program and what requirements they had for its functionality. Then I decided exactly which data structure should be used based on the data that would be stored and how it would be used. Data structures have different strengths and weaknesses so understanding them and how they function is essential for choosing which one to use in any given situation. 
  
3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  The only real roadblock that I had with this project was just getting the bugs out which ended up just being a typo on my part. When I would try to run the code to load the data from the .txt file into the data structure, I kept getting an error that I had never experienced before. Based on where the IDE was pointing me, I thought it was a problem with how I was trying to load the data into the structure. Because of this, I changed the method for loading the data from the way I originally had planned it, thinking that it was wrong. I ended up using the sstream but that still wasn't working. By just reading through my code over and over, I eventually found what was wrong and it was a typo in the Node structure. The structure for creating a Node with a course had a semicolon where there was supposed to be a colon. 
  
4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  I think my work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software by helping me gain a much better depth to my understanding of data structures and how and when to apply them in different situations. This course has also helped me expand my approach to developing a program in general by the time I spent searching for the error in my code. The more experience I get dealing with different error codes, the better I get at recoginizing where the problem may be and so I can more quickly develop my programs in the future and gain a better understanding of any bugs I may encounter.
  
5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  Throughout my work on this project, I gained a lot of understanding of data structures which is very useful knowledge when trying to create an adaptable and maintainable program. I also, as I stated in the above question, had to spend a lot of time debugging my program which is good experience for the future and provided me with even more understanding of the data structure and what errors will look like for different mistakes. Because of the error I always ended up finding a knew way of loading the data into the data structure that I may not have learned until later. And I think, due to my good foundations on coding, that my code has always been fairly clean and readable but practice is always great. Overall, this course taught me a lot and provided me with great practice for the future and development of my coding skills.
